        <p style="text-align: left;"><br><br>The International Committee of the Red Cross has, from the outset, been the
            sponsor of the Geneva Convention for the protection of wounded military
            personnel, and of the humanitarian Conventions which supplement it. Each
            of these fundamental international agreements is inspired by respect for hu-
            man personality and dignity; together, they establish the principle of disin-
            terested aid to all victims of war without discrimination – to all those who,
            whether through wounds, capture or shipwreck, are no longer enemies but
            merely suffering and defenceless human beings.<br><br><br>
            Throughout the years, the International Committee has laboured unremit-
            tingly for the greater protection in International Law of the individual against
            the hardships of war; it successively elaborated the humanitarian Conventions
            and adapted them to current needs, or instituted new ones. In the period
            between the two World Wars, the Committee’s main achievement lay in the
            establishment of a number of draft Conventions, chief among which was the
            Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War; this was signed in the
            summer of 1929 and, during the last conflict, protected millions of captives.
            Other new or revised draft Conventions were to have been submitted to a
            Diplomatic Conference which the Swiss Federal Council planned to convene
            early in1940; hostilities, unfortunately, intervened.<br><br><br>
            The year 1945 marked the close of a war waged on an unprecedented scale; the
            task had to be faced of developing and adapting the humanitarian elements
            of International Law in the light of the experience gained. The International
            Committee’s proposals met with the early approval of Governments and
            National Red Cross Societies, and it immediately set to work.<br><br><br>
            Three former Conventions had to be revised: the Geneva Convention of 1929
            for the Relief of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field, the Xth Hague
            Convention of 1907 for the adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles
            of the Geneva Convention, and the 1929 Convention on the Treatment of
            Prisoners of War. Furthermore, there was urgent need for a Convention for
            the protection of civilians, the absence of which had, during the world con-
            flict, led to such grievous consequences.<br><br><br><br>
