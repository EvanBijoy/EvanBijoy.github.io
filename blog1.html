        <h1 style="color: red;">BLOG 1</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><br><br>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
            the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
            yellow sun.<br><br><br>
            Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is
            an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
            descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
            think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.<br><br><br>
            This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
            of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
            Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of
            these were largely concerned with the movements of small green
            pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the
            small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.<br><br><br>
            And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
            most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
            Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
            mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And
            some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no
            one should ever have left the oceans.<br><br><br>
            And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one
            man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to
            be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a
            small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that
            had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the
            world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
            right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
            anything.<br><br><br>
            Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone-
            about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was
            lost forever.<br><br><br><br>
